#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Software engineering systematically applies to engineering principles, methods and tools to design, develop, test, deploy and to maintain high-quality software systems.
It is important in tech industy because it helps in the creation of software applications and also systems that power various aspects of modern life (e.g. healthcare, finance, communication etc.).

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

1. The establishment of software Engineering discipline in the 1960s
2. Development of programming languages (e.g. Fortran, C)
3. Rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

Well SDLC phases include:
* Requirement - which has to do with documenting user needs.
* Design - creating a high-level easy to use design of the software architecture.
* Implementation - writing codes according to the specific design.
* Testing - ensuring the software meets quality standard by conducting various test.
* Deployment - Releasing the softwares to users or customers.
* Maintenance - providing ongoing support and updates to the software after deployment.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

The waterfall methodology is carried out one after the other as in the software development life cycle. While the agile is iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibility, collaboration, and responding to change.

Waterfall will be suitable for projects with well defined, stable requirements (e.g. financial system with fixed requirement)
Agile will be appropriate for projects with evolving requirements and need for frequent adjustments (e.g. developing a mobile app) 

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

- A software developer is responsible for designing, coding, testing, and maintaining software applications.
- A Quality Assurance Engineer is responsible for making sure of the software quality by designing and excuting test plans.
- A project manager oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of software systems.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

Imagine there no IDEs software suites, it probably will be difficult writing, debugging and also testing codes.
Examples are: Visual studio, Eclipse etc.
VCS are also important because they help us track changes to source code and also coordinating work among team members.
Examples are: Git, Subversion etc.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Some common challenges faced by software engineers are:
* Changing requirements
* Tight deadlines
* Technical debt
* 
To overcome the above challenges, we need:
effective communication, project goals, reassessment, prioritization of tasks and timeline

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
_ Unit testing: Testing individual components of modules of software.
_ Integration testing: Testing interactions between different components or subsystems.
_ System testing: Testing the entire software as a whole.
_ Acceptance testing: Testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.

The various testing types above are important in quality assurance, as they are the critical aspect of ensuring that software products meets specified quality standards and functional requirements.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is all about crafting your questions or instructions in a way that helps get the best responses from your robot or AI assistant.

Importance of prompt engineering is that effective prompt give relevant output and reduce the likelihood of the AI providing misleading or incorrect information.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague Prompt: "What is prompt."
Improved Prompt: "What is prompt. In terms of software Engineering."

The improved prompt is more effective, because it leads to a more targeted and useful response. It reduces the chances of the AI providing information that is too broad, irrelevant, or off-topic.
